Hello! 

My name is Volodymyr and this is my very own personal website - the first task for the [Binary Studio Academy](https://academy.binary-studio.com/). 
Basically this is just an online version of the résumé using HTML, CSS and [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI) - a development framework that helps create beautiful, responsive layouts using human-friendly HTML.
